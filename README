This plugin provides data for Pokemon. It also searches bulbapedia for missing stats.

The following (non-core) Python Modules are (currently) required:
- python-mysqldb
- python-beautifulsoup

Rename and edit the "dbinfo.py.default" with correct credentials to "dbinfo.py".
The (currently incomplete) database can be imported via pokemon.sql
